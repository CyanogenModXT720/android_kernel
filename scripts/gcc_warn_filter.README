# 
# "-Wall" is used for gcc by default when building kernel
# Any warnings reported by gcc will lead to build failure
#
# This file defines rules to filter out warnings in specific src files
#
# NOTE: 
# The main purpose of filter is to handle warnings in 
# a) Original OSS code
# b) Code from 3rd paty
# "zero build warning" is expected for code changed/added by Motorola
#
#
# For example:
# 1) To ignore gcc warnings at line#720 in .../arch/arm/mm/mmu.c
#    "arch/arm/mm/mmu.c:720" shall be added
#
#    NOTE: 
#    a) Relative path shall be used rather than absolute path
#    	I.e. NOT use "/my_repo/xxx/.../kernel/arch/arm/..." 
#    b) There is NO space allowed before/after ":"
#    c) There is NO space alloed after "720"
#    d) More than one rule can be added for one file
#    	arch/arm/mm/mmu.c:720
#    	arch/arm/mm/mmu.c:900
#
# 2) To ignore ALL gcc warnings in .../arch/arm/mm/mmu.c
#    "arch/arm/mm/mmu.c" shall be added
#
# 3) To ignore gcc warnings for ALL files under .../arch/arm/mm
#    "arch/arm/mm" shall be added
#     NOTE:
#     a) There is NO "/" at the end of folder name
#     b) Only the lowest level folder is supported
#        I.e. Don't expect "arch/arm" can filter warnings from "...arch/arm"
