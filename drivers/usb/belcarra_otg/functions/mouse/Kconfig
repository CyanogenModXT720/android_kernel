config OTG_MOUSE
        tristate "  Random Mouse Function"
        depends on OTG
	---help---
        This implements a simple Mouse driver that sends HID packets with
        small random movements. This is a good function for initial testing
        of Peripheral Controller Drivers as it provides for a complicated
        enumeration but a simple uni-directional (send Interrupt only) data
        transport.

config OTG_MOUSE_INTERFACE
	bool "Build an interface module"
	depends on OTG && OTG_MOUSE
	default "y"
	---help---
	This module needs a composite function module, such as 
	mouse_cf or generic_cf to be activated

config OTG_MOUSE_COMPOSITE
	bool "Build a simple OTG 2.x style composite function with mouse"
	depends on  OTG && OTG_MOUSE && OTG_MOUSE_INTERFACE
	default "n"
	---help---
	This module provides a very simple composite function to drive
	the mouse_if module (see above).  The generic_cf module provides
	a much richer composite function supporting multiple functions.

config OTG_MOUSE_TRADITIONAL
	bool "Build an OTG 1.x style function module/driver"
	depends on OTG && OTG_MOUSE
	default "n"
	---help---
	This is the mouse function driver from previous releases. It 
	does not use the composite/interface mechanism. If this module
	is used, neither of the other two mouse modules is required.

config OTG_MOUSE_VENDORID
        hex "VendorID (hex value)"
        depends on OTG && OTG_MOUSE
        default "0x15ec"
	---help---
	This parameter is not used by the mouse_if module because the
	composite layer is responsible for setting this parameter

config OTG_MOUSE_PRODUCTID
        hex "ProductID (hex value)"
        depends on OTG && OTG_MOUSE
        default "0xf003"
	---help---
	Parameters such as PRODUCTID, VENDORID are now the responsibility
	of the composite driver rather than the interface driver. For this
	reason, the module parameters vendor_id, etc are not available in
	the interface versions. Therefore, appropriate values should be set
	in the kernel configuration. These configuration parameters
	are referenced in both mouse_cf and generic_cf.

	---help---
        Implement the Mouse send packet in a bottom half handler,
        this will delay responses to test the PCD works correctly
        when the host polls before a send data urb is queued.

config OTG_MOUSE_PACKETS
        int "Number of packets (zero is continous)"
        depends on OTG && OTG_MOUSE
        default 10
	---help---
        Number of Mouse packets to send, will run
        forever if set to zero.

config OTG_MOUSE_STALL
        bool "  MOUSE Stall Test"
        depends on OTG && OTG_MOUSE

        Periodically stall the INTERRUPT endpoint.
        Used for testing.
