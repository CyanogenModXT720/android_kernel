 * @brief Freescale USB Host Controller Driver
 *
 * This is a complete and self contained Linux 2.6 USB Host Driver.
 *
 * It also conforms to the requirements for use as an OTG HCD driver
 * in the Belcarra OTG Stack.
 *
 * The hardware is an integrated design, so it also works in conjunction 
 * with the mxc OCD and PCD drivers to share the hardware under the direction
 * of the OTG State Machine.

/*! Data Structures Overview
 *
 * Urbs point at:
 *
 *      struct urb {
 *              struct  usb_device *udev;
 *      }
 *
 * Udev points at hdev (stuct hcd_dev) via:
 *
 *      struct usb_device {
 *              void *hcpriv;
 *      }
 *
 * Hdev is a simple structure for each "device" on the bus that the host has
 * enumerated. It contains an array of void *ep[32] which contains pointers
 * to active requests indexed using the endpoint number and direction. This
 * allows us to find an active request using endpoint information provided
 * by the hcd layer:
 *
 *      struct hcd_dev {        // usb_device.hcpriv points to this 
 *
 *              struct list_head        dev_list;       // on this hcd
 *              struct list_head        urb_list;       // pending on this dev
 *              void                    *ep[32];        // per-configuration hc/hcd state such as qh or ed
 *      }
 *
 *
 * The host drivers are not allowed to use the urb->urb_list so we will keep 
 * our own list of inactive requests using the mxc_req structure. Note that
 * we track the epnum (derived from endpoint information provided by the
 * hcd layer) and etdn (the hardware slot number) for the request if it
 * is schedule:
 *
 *      struct mxc_req {
 *              struct urb              *urb;
 *              struct list_head        queue;
 *
 *              int                     epnum;
 *              int                     etdn;
 *      };
 *
 *
 *
 * The mxc_hcd structure contains:
 *
 *      struct mxc_hcd {
 *              struct list_head        unused;                         // unused requests
 *              struct list_head        inactive;                       // in-active requests
 *              struct mxc_req          *active[NUM_ETDS];               // active requests by ETD 
 *      };
 *
 * Requests are allocated on the fly when needed, but saved in the unused 
 * queue when finished.
 *
 * Requests that are pending are in the inactive queue. The scheduler will
 * attempt to start any inactive requests when new requests are queued or
 * old requests are finished.
 *
 * Requests can stay on the inactive queue for two reasons, first if there is already
 * an active request for that device and endpoint (by verifying ep[] list is null) or
 * if there are no available resources (x/y buffers or etd slots.)
 *
 * The mxc_hcd structure will have a list of NUM_ETD pointer to active
 * requests. If the array is NULL then the ETD is not being used. The active
 * array is indexed by the ETD (hardware) number that the request is
 * scheduled on.
 *
 *
 * The primary reason for the inactive queue is that while the TDI design 
 * handles all of the details about a transfer until it is complete, it can
 * only handle a limited number (NUM_ETDS) of requests at a time. So if there
 * are more requests to valid device/endpoint combinations than there are ETD's
 * then some will have to wait. 
 *
 * Generally the maximum number of ETD's that can be used for any device is 1 (for the
 * control endpoint) plus the number of endpoints defined in the device's configuration
 * descriptor.
 *
 * It may be necessary to de-activate previously started requests periodically
 * if there is more work than can be handled. This will require three things:
 *
 *      - setup of etd registers in mxc request
 *      - start mxc request based on etd in mxc request
 *      - code to de-activate by saving etd in mxc request and place at end of inactive list
 *
 * IFF we can safely stop the ETD then the above would safely get it restarted.
 *
 * It may be safest to stop ETD's from SOF interrupt when (presumably) there is
 * no active tranfers.
